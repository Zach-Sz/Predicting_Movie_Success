ENGG3130 Project
We created a Jupyter Notebook that tries to determine how much money a movie is predicted to make. As well, we try and predict how many Oscars a movie is likely to earn.
We web-scraped the IMDb website and did much data cleaning and pre-processing. Next we used regression models to predict how much money the movie will make and classification models for how many Oscars they will earn. All code and descriptions can be found in the Jupyter Notebook. In addition, we wrote a report outlining ou observations and room for improvement.
